    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 tbls butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cups (90g) cake flour (different than all purpose flour, less protein/gluten in it)</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar (90g) </li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>7 inch pan (super important)</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Instructions</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
        <li>Grab a pot and fill with water. Set on low heat to simmer the water (we’ll get to this)</li>
        <li>Line the 7 inch pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sides. I lined the bottom, then cut strips that could curl around for the sides. This mostly worked. </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, use a sifter or strainer that is small enough to sift the flour two times</li>
        <li>In another bowl (if you have a stand mixer use that bowl. I still do not, and my newly ripped right arm equal parts hates and was alright with this. It’s not the worst if you don’t have it, but it’ll add about 15 extra minutes to this step) add the eggs and sugar</li>
        <li>Place this bowl over the pot of simmering water (told you!) and whisk the crap out of it. You need the eggs to get to a lukewarm temperature and all the sugar to dissolve</li>
        <li>When the sugar has dissolved and the eggs are luke warm, remove your bowl from the pot and back to your prep area.</li>
        <li>If you have a mixer, whip the eggs and sugar until they turn a light cake batter beige color and thicken where lifting the paddles ribbons or pours it and keeps a bit of it’s shape. Be careful not to overdo this or you’ll lose the air</li>
        <li>If you don’t have a mixer, you’re in for a long ride. Use the whisk and keep going. Just keep whisking. It’ll change from soup eggs to a thicker cake batter eventually. Good luck, take breaths, don’t tense up too much. Change hands if you can to give breaks. You’ll get there. </li>
        <li>Add the vanilla and stir in</li>
        <li>Split your flour into 3 parts visually. </li>
        <li>Add the first third to the eggs and use a spatula to fold it in</li>
        <li>When all the flour is mixed in, add the next third</li>
        <li>Add the last third and fold in that flour</li>
        <li>Grab another bowl and add the milk and butter. Melt this however you see fit. I used a microwave</li>
        <li>Add to the egg mixture and fold it in as well</li>
        <li>Pour into your prepared 7 inch cake pan</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes</li>
        <li>Cool for at least 15 minutes</li>
    </ol>
