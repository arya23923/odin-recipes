    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil to cover bottom of the pot and for the pasta</li>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ large white onion diced</li>
        <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2-3 bay leafs</li>
        <li>about ½ tbsp Italian spices</li>
        <li>½ tsp or less of sugar</li>
        <li>½ lb of spaghetti</li>
        <li>f you have some fresh sweet basil (optional and to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat up the oil and add the onions. Cook in med low until they are slightly soft and slightly see through not all the way. about 3-5 mins</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook on low for another 3 minuets till everything is soft and slightly colored. Dont cook it till it’s brown then it’ll be burnt and wont taste good</li>
        <li>Open the can of crushed tomatoes and add it. Cook on med low for about 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the bay leafs, Italian spices, salt, and pepper and if you have some fresh basil stir everything and let it cook for another 10-15 minuets. Now if you arent sure about how much spices you want I would add a little bit and add more if you feel like you need it. It is easier to add then to take away and you dont want the sauce to be ruined by over seasoning it.</li>
        <li>After the sauces has been cooking I like to taste it at this point and see how it tastes. Then I’ll add the sugar again same thing add a little and taste till it’s perfect for you. I then cook for another 5 minutes and then turn the heat off and let it stand.</li>
        <li>As the sauce is standing I start the pasta. Just put a pot of water on the stove and wait for it to boil.Once it’s boiling I add a little salt and oil this keeps the pasta from sticking and gives it a little bit of a taste.</li>
        <li>I like my pasta al dente so I check after 9-10 minuets to see if it’s ready if you like it softer then wait longer.</li>
        <li>Strain the pasta heat up the sauce quickly if it’s cooled too much and it’s done!</li>
    </ul>
